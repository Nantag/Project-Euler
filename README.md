# Project-Euler

My attempts to solve the Project Euler questions. Aiming for mathematically efficient, but simple code, with good doccumentation of ideas and mathematical solutions.

Solutions are written in Visual C++. C was originally used, but due to concerns that building framework would take precedence over solving the questions themselves, the project was switched to Visual C++.
